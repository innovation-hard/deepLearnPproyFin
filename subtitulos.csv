"02:14:37,779","02:14:42,075"," Come in, she said I'll give you shelter from the storm "
"02:14:50,416","02:14:54,462", Suddenly I turned around And she was standing there 
"02:14:54,629","02:14:58,591", With silver bracelets on her wrists And flowers in her hair 
"02:14:58,758","02:15:03,054", She walked up to me so gracefully And took my crown of thorns 
"02:15:03,221","02:15:07,392"," Come in, she said I'll give you shelter from the storm "
"02:17:40,128 --> 02:17:44,382  I know the language of your laugh "
"02:17:45,591","02:17:49,053", Tripping over circumstance 
"02:17:50,721","02:17:55,435", I know the story of your walk 
"02:17:56,227","02:17:59,897", I taste the sugar and the salt 
"02:18:01,607","02:18:06,904", I taste and savor your little ways 
"02:18:08,531","02:18:12,618", The colors that you choose 
"02:18:13,161","02:18:15,371", To paint your day
